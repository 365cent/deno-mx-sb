Welcome to my blog!

***

This site is proudly powered by [Deno.js](https://deno.land) and [Lume](https://lume.land), and the template is a highly modified version of the [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) default theme.

The source code of this site is stored on GitHub, and the site assets are stored on [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). We are using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org) to implement workflow automation.

Thanks to them for making this site possible!
